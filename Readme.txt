# Find-My-Pet

## Overview
"Find My Pet" is an AI-powered application designed to help reunite lost pets with their owners. When someone finds a lost pet, they can take a picture and upload it to our database. If a pet owner loses their pet, they can upload a previous picture of their pet. The system then matches the uploaded image with the images in the database to find potential matches.

## Features
- **Image Upload:** Allows users to upload images of found and lost pets.
- **Embeddings Generation:** Converts images to embeddings using a trained ResNet50 model.
- **Matching System:** Matches the embeddings of the uploaded image with those in the database to identify potential matches.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning:** ResNet50 for generating image embeddings
- **Database:** Qdrant for storing image embeddings and metadata
- **Deployment:** Server on local_pc
